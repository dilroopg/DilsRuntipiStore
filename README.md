# Dil's Runtipi AppStore
Add this appstore by copying https://github.com/dilroopg/DilsRuntipiStore/ into your runtipi repo settings.

## Repository Structure

- **apps/**: Contains individual app directories

May add more apps in the future, for now I will just be fixing any with small issues I run in to.  

# Apps Added
Mylar 3
- /runtipi/media/data/comics	/comics
  /runtipi/media/downloads/mylar3	/downloads
  Was missing from the docker compose, added that so it works with runtipis file structuring with other apps like komga, kavita, etc.
